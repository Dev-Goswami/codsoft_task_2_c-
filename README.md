# codsoft_task_2_c-

This is my internship project, developed during my B.Tech 2nd year in Computer Science.
The project is a simple calculator built using C++,
designed with a unique console-based user interface using ANSI escape codes to enhance the UI experience in the terminal.

The main aim of this project is to demonstrate how we can use C++ not just for backend logic but also to build a more interactive and colorful UI in a console environment without using any external libraries
